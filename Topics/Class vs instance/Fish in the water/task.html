One of the class attributes is <strong>n_fish </strong>which corresponds to the number of fish that have been created (and are now in the aquarium).</p><p>In the code below, you can see that there's <strong>greg, </strong>the only fish that has been created so far. Update the value of <strong>n_fish </strong>in the correct way.</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Remember that integer is an immutable type and class attributes of this kind have to be accessed through the class itself so that changes affect all instances of the class.</p></div><p></p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
